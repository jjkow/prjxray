1. cd to `minitests/partial_reconf_test`
2. change in zybo.sh vars to:
    export WITH_ZYNQ=1
    export WITH_BOOTGEN=0
    export WITH_BLACKBOX=1
    export WITH_TEST1=0
    export WITH_TEST2=0

this will produce only "blackbox" + static logic
which is single blinking LED

3. ./runme.sh UTILS=0
4. cp build/design.bit blackbox.bit
5. change in zybo.sh vars to:
    export WITH_ZYNQ=1
    export WITH_BOOTGEN=0
    export WITH_BLACKBOX=0
    export WITH_TEST1=1
    export WITH_TEST2=0

this will fill the ROI with some additional logic
which is 3-bit counter on LEDs.

6. ./runme.sh UTILS=0
7. ./runme.sg UTILS=1
This produces design.fasm/frm and applies design.fasm
to blackbox.bit -> which produces desgin.bit in example dir.
Next it generates design.bit.bin
(so make sure you have bootgen in PATH)
8. I uploaded bitstreams to FPGA using fpga_manager on Zybo
